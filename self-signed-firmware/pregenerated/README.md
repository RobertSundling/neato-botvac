# Self-Signed Neato Botvac Firmware Signatures

The files in this directory were generated by following the procedure outlined in the [manual certificate and signature generation](../README.md#option-3-manual-process) section of the [README.md file in the parent directory](../README.md). Please see that section for more information.

These files have *not* been tested on an actual Neato Botvac and are provided for those who wish to experiment with their robot to determine if self-signed signatures are accepted.
